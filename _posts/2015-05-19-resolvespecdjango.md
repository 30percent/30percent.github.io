title: Resolve Specification in Django (InProgress)
---

*[Resolve Specification in Django](https://github.com/30percent/ResolveSpecDjango) is a website currently in development intended to be used as the specification for the RESOLVE verification language*

<!--postbreak-->

### Description

The RESOLVE verification language is a research language built from the ground up to be a language for software that is fully specified and the code provably fits the specifications. To that end, the language is reasonably complex, combining both mathematical and programming code. The website is created as a way of specifying cleanly the syntax and semantics of the language in a way that is readable, accessible and convenient.

### Design

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): a web framework that incorporates SQL into python using the Model View Controller methodology to maintain separation of concerns.
* [jstree](http://www.jstree.com/): a jQuery plugin that provides the ability to create a tree for navigation between nodes in the language syntax tree
