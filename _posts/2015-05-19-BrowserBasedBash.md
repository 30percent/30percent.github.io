title: BrowserBasedBash (InProgress)

*[BrowserBasedBash](https://github.com/30percent/BrowserBasedBash) is a website currently in development that attempts to safely allow user based access to Bash scripting on a personal server.*
<!--postbreak-->

### Description

Relatively simple base design for a browser based server access. Much still needs to be done. As it stands, the project allows creation, reading, and updating of scripts to be run by the server under a hardcoded username. The browser's user is treated as any regular user of the server who had physical access. 

### Purpose

This was created to give me access to my home server without needing special apps or permissions. It gave me the ability to run test scripts (and execute simple programs) on the system.
