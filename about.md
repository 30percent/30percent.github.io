<p class="message">
  Hey! My name is Mark Todd, a Computer Science graduate from Clemson University
</p>

I've been interested in computers and software since I was 14 writing equation handlers and text adventures in TI-BASIC. Most of my work has been in C, but recently web-based languages (DjangoPython, JS, PHP) have been the center of my projects. 

During college I was a paid Undergraduate Researcher for the Reusable Software Research Group at Clemson that focuses on the verifiable programming language RESOLVE. During my tenure I worked with the compiler written in Java and created the design for the translation from [RESOLVE to C](https://github.com/30percent/C-Translation).

## Free Time
* I play the guitar, banjo, and ukelele, currently participating every week in the Pickers in the Round at a local bar. During college I was a member of a guitar ensemble.
* I enjoying hiking and have had the opportunity to hike the Foothills Trail, the Appalachian Trail, and the mountains of New Mexico.
* Since working as a tour guide for [Marshgrass Adventures](http://www.marshgrassadventures.com/) I am on the water any chance I get, both for excitement like the Nantahala and the Colorado River and as a chance to explore the wildlife of the Everglades and local lakes.

## Associated Projects
* [RESOLVE through Clemson](http://www.cs.clemson.edu/resolve/): A project whose goal is "of a future in which no production software is considered properly engineered unless it has been fully specified, and fully verified as satisfying these specifications".
